# Calc
This is a terminal based calculator implemented in rust. Graphical interfaces are done in ncurses.

## current features
So far all it can do is solve equations. Do this by passing the equation as arguments, use quotes to in your shell for this.\
It has supoort for:\
&nbsp;&nbsp; operators: +, -, *(multiplication), /(division), %(modulus), and ^(exponentiation)\
&nbsp;&nbsp; functions: sin(sine, all trig functions are in radians), cos(cosine), tan(tangent), floor, ceil(ceiling), round, and abs(absolute value, NOT done via '|')\
evaluation is done in standard pemdas(modulus takes same priority as multiplication and division)
